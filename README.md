### What I learned

Something I learned during this project



```css
.image-container{
    width: 100%;
    height: 50vh; 
    max-height: 302px;
    background-image: url('images/image-equilibrium.jpg');
    background-position: center;
    background-position: fixed;
    background-size: cover; /* This line especially */
}
```

### Continued development

While building this project, I had the most difficulty with setting the hover state for the NFT image. I ended up having to use the ::before attribute in my CSS and a little help from another programmer. I wish to refine my accessibility skills to help me with further similar challenges and projects.


### Useful resources

- [Anerpeco's code](https://github.com/anerpeco/nft-preview-card-component) - This helped me with the hover state for my nft image (the eye icon that displays over the image when the cursor hovers over it). I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward, I will also explore more options.
- [w3schools doc](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me with understanding the concept of overlaying colors on images.
